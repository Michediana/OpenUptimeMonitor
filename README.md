# OpenUptimeMonitor
OpenUPtime Monitor is a free uptime monitor, made to be easy to use and fast to implement.

It's written in PHP, so you can use it wherever you want, even on cheap hosting.

It uses a SQLite database, so you have not to configure a DB connection.

# How to install

 1. Download ZIP file
 2. Extract ZIP folder into a hosting with: PHP >7.1 and SQLite extension enabled in php.ini
 3. Set a cronjob (decide by yourself the frequency, by default 5 mins) executing the cron.php file
 4. You're done!

Now you can add domains on the dashboard and keep track of their online status.
